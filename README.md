# Blockchain-Based CCTV Evidence Preservation System

## 🚀 Overview
This project is a **blockchain-based solution** designed to securely store metadata of CCTV footage, ensuring it is tamper-proof and accessible only through authorized channels. It integrates **AI technology** to analyze and extract meaningful insights from the footage, providing a robust and reliable system for justice and security.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
In critical cases like murders, robberies, or societal crimes, CCTV footage often gets lost, tampered with, or deleted, delaying investigations and hindering justice. Centralized storage systems are vulnerable to hacking and unauthorized access, making evidence preservation a challenge.

## 🔑 Features
### **Blockchain**
- Tamper-proof storage of CCTV metadata.
- Secure and decentralized evidence preservation.
- Transparent access control for authorized entities.

### **IPFS**
- Decentralized storage of full video files.
- Content-addressable storage for efficient retrieval.

### **AI Integration**
- **Activity Detection**: Identifies suspicious movements or events.
- **Caption Generation**: Extracts summaries of footage for metadata storage.
- **Facial/Object Recognition**: Detects individuals, vehicles, or objects for investigative purposes.

### **Frontend (React)**
- User-friendly interface for accessing and managing metadata.
- Real-time status monitoring and data insights.

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. **Data Capture**: CCTV cameras record footage continuously.
2. **AI Analysis**: AI models analyze the footage to extract relevant metadata (e.g., timestamps, events).
3. **Blockchain Storage**: Critical metadata is securely stored on the blockchain for tamper-proofing.
4. **IPFS Storage**: Full video footage is stored decentrally in IPFS, linked to blockchain hashes.
5. **Secure Access**: Only authorized users can retrieve metadata or video footage through a secure interface.

## 🌟 Use Cases
- **Crime Investigations**: Preserve evidence to support justice in critical cases like murders, thefts, or accidents.
- **Public Safety**: Enhance societal security by ensuring reliable evidence storage.
- **Compliance**: Meet legal and regulatory requirements for evidence handling.

## 📌 Technology Stack
- **Blockchain**: For decentralized, secure storage of metadata.
- **IPFS**: For storing complete video files decentrally.
- **AI**: For activity detection, caption generation, and recognition.
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: For backend services and integration.
- **Smart Contracts**: For managing blockchain operations.

## 🔍 Real-World Impact
In India, over **70% of CCTV cameras** rely on centralized systems prone to tampering. By adopting this solution, we ensure justice is served without delays caused by missing or altered evidence.
